### Observations

1. The silhouette score calculates the distance between each data point in a cluster and the points in its surrounding clusters. The clusters are better separated when the silhouette score is higher.

2. The silhouette score for the K means clustering maximises at 4 clusters, and the cluster graphs show that 4 clusters suit the graphs.
