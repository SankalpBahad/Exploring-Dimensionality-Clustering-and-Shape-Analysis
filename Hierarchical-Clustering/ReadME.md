## Observations

The generated cluster architectures are greatly influenced by the linkage method selection.

Single linkage may cause chaining and increased sensitivity to outliers, although it is appropriate for locating elongated or non-globular clusters.

Complete connection creates compact, well-separated clusters but may overlook smaller ones.

Average linkage offers a balanced strategy and is adaptable to different cluster sizes and configurations.

When striving for small, evenly-sized clusters with little within-cluster variance, Ward's linkage is the best option.

The type of linkage used should be compatible with the features of the data and clustering objectives.
